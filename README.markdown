PlayHaven iOS Coding Challenge v2.0
===================================

Thanks for your interest in joining PlayHaven! We ask all of our
candidates to demonstrate coding ability with code challenges such as 
this one.

You should have an XCode project (PlayHavenChallenge) that includes
everything you need to get started.

This is a working iOS app that displays a simple table view with a
small collection of items ("One" through "Nine") each having a
corresponding image URL.

Your challenge is to load and display the image URL for the item in
each row.

Once complete you should zip up your entire XCode project along with
any additional files (if needed). Append your name to the archive, 
like so:

PlayHavenChallenge.JohnDoe.zip

Your solution will be evaluated for performance, particularly
scrolling performance of resulting UI, as well as general good
coding practice in your source code.
